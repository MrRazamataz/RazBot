# RazBot
The repo for the new (in dev) version of RazBot

## Todo:
- [ ] Permissons system. I was thinking having discord permissons (like kick/ban) override RazBot permissons. But allow setup of differnet roles to do tasks that discord permissons don't cover. Also allow setting of "full access" users but this may not bypass certain admin checks, like clear all data commands etc..
